# 🌥️ Starting My Cloud Journey

Today I began documenting my path to becoming a **Cloud Security Engineer** and future **AI Engineer**.  
I’m learning **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **AWS**, and **DevOps tools** to automate and secure cloud environments.

---

### 🧩 What I Learned Today
- How to use **Terraform** to deploy secure infrastructure  
- Why **version control (GitHub)** matters for DevOps workflows  
- The importance of **building something every day** to build skills and consistency

---

### 💡 Reflection
Each small project brings me one step closer to my vision —  
to **build secure, automated, and intelligent systems** that make cloud security smarter.
